# RASAP 1.0
Table.xls contains list of 416 mammalian autophagic proteins, their dissection into core proteins, further categorization into the functional subgroup viz., ULK complex, PI3K complex, ATG9 complex and UBL conjugation system. Quantitative information of the experimental structural coverage of each of the proteins is enlisted along with AF2 predicted pLDDT scores for residues with no experimental structural coverage. In addition, IDRs predicted with IUPRED2 is compared with AF2 predicted pLDDT scores.

AF2_models.zip contains 5 AF2 predicted models of autophagic proteins/complexes, computed using standalone application of AF2. Core proteins with experimental structural coverage less than 90% in humans were taken for prediction. These include: ATG2A, ATG14, ATG10, FIP200, AMBRA1, ULK4. In addition, AF2 predicted ATG7 and ATG7-ATG10 tetramer complex models are also provided.

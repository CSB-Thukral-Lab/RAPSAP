**Resource of AF2 predicted structures of autophagy pathway**

Welcome to our GitHub repository! Here, we present a resource package that utilizes AlphaFold2, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, for improving the structural spectrum of autophagy proteins. The protein structural bandwidth of multiple proteomes has been greatly improved with the release of Google DeepMindâ€™s AI-driven AlphaFold which can be utilized as an open-source tool .This  has significantly improved structural coverage of the proteins, which earlier lacked atomistic resolution with reasonable confidence, over previous protein prediction methods. Using the tool, we have analysed the autophagic interactome, which is comprised of key autophagic proteins and several interacting partners.

With AF2 It is now possible to explore and predict the structures of numerous monomeric and multimeric protein complexes that were previously inaccessible. 
This user-friendly framework called Resource of AF2 predicted structures of autophagy pathway contains structural information on the proteins that are involved in the autophagic process. Moreover, the resource contains predicted protein structures that can be downloaded and utilized for further analysis and study, facilitating understanding of autophagic processes. With the help of our resource, researchers can comprehensively analyse the protein structures, and potentially use them for drug development and other research inferences. We are excited to share this resource with the scientific community and hope that it can contribute to further advances in the structural understanding of proteins involved in the autophagy process.

**Contents**

1.Autophagic Protein Interactome  contains two separate folders containing structural information of 416 mammalian autophagic proteins characterized according to their structural coverage to unearth structural bandwidth in autophagic proteins interaction network. First category contains .pdb structures of all the proteins which have structural coverage less than 90 percent and vice versa along with a table highlighting broad information on the respective proteins.

2.Core Autophagic proteins is a list of proteins which is subdivied between high , medium and low categories according to the percentage of atomistic resolution avilable along with a table of respective proteins.

3.Multimer Contains models of standalone AF2 predicted prediected structures. 

4.Simulation of High Confidence Structures

**Usage**

1.You can easily download the .pdb files and can view using any interactive and visulaization tools like chimera, chimeraX etc.

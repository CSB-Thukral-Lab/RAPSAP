# RASAP 
Resource of AF2 predicted structures of autophagy pathway is a resource that contains strutural information on the proteins that are involved in the autophagic database.
Autophagy is a evolutionary conserved, highly regulated process that is required for the removal of unwanted materials from the cell to maintain cellular homeostasis.
Multiple protein participates in the crusade to maintain this crucial process. Previously due to complexity nature of the experiments to resolve  crystal structures of proteins , the structural bandwith of the proteome was less understood in terms of mechanistic and dynamic characterization . With the availability of AI driven AlpaFold from Google deepmind as a open source tool , structural bandwith of protein is significantly increased.

RASAP is Resource of AF2 Predicted structures of autophagy pathway. This repository was created to enhance the strutural data of the proteins that are specifically involed in autophagy.

Table.xls contains list of 416 mammalian autophagic proteins, their dissection into core proteins, further categorization into the functional subgroup viz., ULK complex, PI3K complex, ATG9 complex and UBL conjugation system. Quantitative information of the experimental structural coverage of each of the proteins is enlisted along with AF2 predicted pLDDT scores for residues with no experimental structural coverage. In addition, IDRs predicted with IUPRED2 is compared with AF2 predicted pLDDT scores.

AF2_models.zip contains 5 AF2 predicted models of autophagic proteins/complexes, computed using standalone application of AF2. Core proteins with experimental structural coverage less than 90% in humans were taken for prediction. These include: ATG2A, ATG14, ATG10, FIP200, AMBRA1, ULK4. In addition, AF2 predicted ATG7 and ATG7-ATG10 tetramer complex models are also provided.

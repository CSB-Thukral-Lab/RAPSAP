**Resource of AF2 predicted structures of autophagy pathway**
***
Welcome to our GitHub repository! Here, we present a resource package that utilizes AlphaFold2, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, for improving the structural spectrum of autophagy proteins. The protein structural bandwidth of multiple proteomes has been greatly improved with the release of Google DeepMind’s AI-driven AlphaFold (https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold) which can be utilized as an open-source tool .This  has significantly improved structural coverage of the proteins, which earlier lacked atomistic resolution with reasonable confidence, over previous protein prediction methods. Using the tool, we have analysed the autophagic interactome, which is comprised of key autophagic proteins and several interacting partners.

With AF2 It is now possible to explore and predict the structures of monomeric and multimeric protein complexes that were previously not accessible. 
This user-friendly framework called Resource of AF2 predicted structures of autophagy pathway contains structural information on the proteins that are involved in the autophagic process. Moreover, the resource contains predicted protein structures that can be downloaded and utilized for further analysis and study, facilitating understanding of autophagic processes. With the help of our resource, researchers can comprehensively analyse the protein structures, and potentially use them for drug development and other research inferences. We are excited to share this resource with the scientific community and hope that it can contribute to further advances in the structural understanding of proteins involved in the autophagy process.

**Contents**
***
* Autophagic Protein Interactome contains information on mammalian autophagic proteins’  comprising structural data which  is in two separate folders. To determine the structural bandwidth in the network of interactions between autophagic proteins, these proteins have been evaluated based on their structural coverage. The first folder includes the structural data in .pdb format for all the proteins that have a structural coverage of less than 90 percent. The second folder, on the other hand, contains the structural data for the remaining proteins with a structural coverage of 90 percent or more. Additionally, a table highlighting relevant information about each protein is also provided.

* Core Autophagic proteins is a list of proteins which is subdivied between high, medium and low structures according to the percentage of atomistic resolution available along with a table of proteins.

* Multimer Contains models of standalone AF2 predicted prediected structures of ATG7-ATG10. Top 5 ranked structures have been uploaded with open access. To further understand the proteins dynamics of the multimeric proteins we perfromed md simulation of the ATG7-ATG10 tetramer and found three key critical interactions that were further modelled and simulated insilico. Wildtype and Mutant ATG7-ATG10 tetramer contains all structural files at different time step to understand protein evolution in tetramer assembly.


* Simulation of High Confidence Structures folder contains .pdb files of ATG2,ATG10 and ATG14. Each subfolder of these protein contains .pdb files at different timescale from 1 microsecond of trajectory.

**Usage**
***
* You can easily download the .pdb files and can view them using any interactive and visulaization tools like chimera, chimeraX etc.
